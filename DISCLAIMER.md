This code is for research and educational purposes only.
It is NOT intended for production cryptographic use.
NOT all security properties are formally proven.
Parameters could be reduced or simplified intentionally.
Some constructions are toy or experimental models inspired by real schemes.
The goal is to study cryptographic concepts, attacks, and protocol behavior, not to provide secure implementations.
