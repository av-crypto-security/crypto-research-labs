# Hybrid Classical-PQC Authentication Experiments

This directory is reserved for research on hybrid authentication
and key agreement schemes combining classical cryptography
(ECDH / ECDSA-like) with post-quantum primitives (Kyber).

The goal is to explore minimal-overhead PQC-assisted authenticity
and key confirmation mechanisms.
