This repository aggregates research-oriented cryptographic implementations,
including classical constructions, protocol-level attacks, and
post-quantum inspired experiments.

The focus is on understanding cryptographic behavior, misuse patterns,
and security implications rather than providing production-ready code.

This repository aggregates work from independent cryptographic research,
practical experiments, and academic studies in applied cryptography and security.
